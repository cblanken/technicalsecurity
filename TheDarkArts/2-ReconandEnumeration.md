# Recon and Enumeration

99% of hacking is recon and enumeration, knowing the network. As an
attacker, you are looking for misconfiguration, weak services, anything
that can give you and edge. As a defender, you need to know what is on
your network, what is visible to the network, and if there are any
weaknesses that you should go and fix. Whoever knows the network best,
wins.

**Assignment: **

To practice your enumeration skills, you have my permission to conduct
an external recon of the IPs, ports, and services related to
hoppersroppers.org using the tools you just learned. Submit your
findings, as boring as they might be. Don't spend too much time on this,
and please don't try to hack the site, I promise there is nothing
interesting and this is not a hacking challenge.

You might be thinking to yourself, well I should try scanning my
school's network, or some other website... Don't do it. While it is
legal, there is a very serious chance you wind up getting talked to
extremely sternly or worse if you put packets on the wire and people
have to go investigate what is going on. This knowledge should only be
used against training machines or websites you have explicit permission
to enumerate.
