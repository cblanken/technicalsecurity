# Baby Steps

These next few challenges will work you all the way through the
killchain. 

-   [Blue](https://tryhackme.com/room/blue) - Deploy & hack into a
    Windows machine, leveraging common misconfigurations issues

-   [Simple CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/easyctf) - A
    beginner-friendly Capture the Flag

-   [Bounty Hacker](https://tryhackme.com/room/cowboyhacker) - Prove
    that you’re the most elite hacker in the solar system, and claim
    your right to the status of Elite Bounty Hacker!

  

For the assignment, submit a short writeup on one of the challenges
detailing what you did and what a defender could have done to stop you.

Again, remember that this knowledge is only to be used in CTFs and
against training machines, never in the real world. Do not go trying
these techniques against other people's websites or computers.
