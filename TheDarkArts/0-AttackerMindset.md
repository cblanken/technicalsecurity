# Attacker Mindset

I've spend a lot of time trying to help you get into the defender
mindset and understand risk so far, but it's time to get into the
attacker mindset. 

Red teaming is super easy to teach, and to do, compared to playing
defense. So I've decided to start by teaching some extremely basic
things to get your brain thinking about this from all angles. 

We are going to lean on some fantastic training from TryHackMe to move
through these next steps. I will mostly just send you to their site to
do their activities, but I will add my own context and a bit more
discussion here. 

**I really want to drive home, this is the part where you could start
getting into trouble if you start using the skills you learn here
against people in the real world. If you scan your school network or try
to run these tools against people you know, you could very possibly be
breaking the law and there could really be serious legal
consequences. **
