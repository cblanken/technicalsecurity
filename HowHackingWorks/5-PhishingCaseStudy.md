Pen Test is short for penetration testing, which basically means
breaking into someone's stuff in order to help make them more secure by
identifying vulnerabilities and helping to fix them. In the civilian
world, you can do this for a job. While the military has "red teams"
which perform attacks on friendly networks to help make our defenses
better, the rest of the military who does this kind of work usually
doesn't tell the people they hack how to make their systems more
secure....Mostly because those people have already had all their stuff
stolen/hit hellfire missile/shot. But I digress.

On the second page of this cool poster, learn about a sample network pen
test.

For anything you do not understand, look it up. If looking up doesn't
explain that specific item well in \>5 minutes, add your question to
your question list and write it at the bottom of your submission.

Task:

In your own words, describe what happened using the kill chain. Don't
worry about getting it wrong for now, we'll teach you how to do this
eventually. In addition, write out whatever questions you have about
this and we'll answer them.

You will be doing this for a few more scenarios, the point of writing
out how this happened is so we can help you if you misunderstand things,
as well as answer your questions.
