So how has security adapted to face all these threats? Basically, the
most modern idea is the idea of defense in depth, making it so the bad
guys have to beat layer after layer of security in order to get in, and
then back out. The go-to model is the cyber killchain by Lockheed
Martin, and while it gets a ton of crap, it is honestly a very good way
of looking at it.

Make sure you know the different layers of the killchain. Write a
sentence describing each and provide an example. If you can't think of
examples, google for them. Don't worry too much about being right.

1.  Recon
2.  Weaponization
3.  Delivery
4.  Exploitation
5.  Installation
6.  Command and Control
7.  Actions on Objectives
