# Securing Windows, According to Taylor Swift

# Weaponization/Delivery/Exploitation

Quick refresh on the steps of the killchain:

Weaponization: Once we find out what kind of vulnerabilities or
protocols are running on the system we can find N-Days that we can
weaponize or do vulnerability research ourselves to find 0-Days. 

Delivery: This is where we decide how we will delivery our weaponized
payload that will gain us access. This can be over the wire, through
social engineering, or going somewhere and plugging in a USB.

Exploitation: This is where the actual code of our payload will execute
allowing us to gain access to a system. Everything done after the
initial execution of our code is considered post-exploitation.

To demonstrate these three steps we will be using an exploitation
framework known as Metasploit. We can use Metasploit to pick N-Days,
choose a delivery message, and use different exploitation modules to
execute code.
