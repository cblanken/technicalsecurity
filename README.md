# Introduction

Hopper's Roppers is a website dedicated to providing the best training possible for students who are new to the field. One of the ways that we do this is through a series of free courses.

This is the full text of our  Technical Security Fundamentals course.

This course will not teach you how to be a hacker or a pentester but is the first hands-on lessons you need to build the mental models. Low on theory, high on practical application, this is a bunch of fun and you'll learn a lot.

This site is generated from a course hosted at:

All the material is available here, but in order to get the full benefits of our course we recommend registering so that we can track your progress, grade your submissions, and provide feedback and support when you need it.

If you have any questions, hit us on Twitter @roppersacademy.

If you have recommended changes or feedback, this is all available on GitHub for anyone to submit issues or pull requests. Thanks for the help!
