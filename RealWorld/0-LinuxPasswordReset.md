To demonstrate how easy it is to break into a computer you have physical
access to we are going to do a password reset on your Linux VM you
should have set up in the [Computing Fundamentals
course.](https://www.roppers.org/courses/computing-fundamentals)

This will be the same for the vast majority of Linux Operating Systems,
but a general rule is that you can just Google how to do it for the OS
you are on. I actually had to do this attack the week before I wrote
this section because I accidentally corrupted the password file on my
box (protip: don't test the rootkit you are writing on your actual
machine) and couldn't get back in. Had to do this reset to make a new
account and recover everything. See! Hacking is Useful!

This maneuver is generally known as a "Grub Bootloader attack".

Here is a starting point.
